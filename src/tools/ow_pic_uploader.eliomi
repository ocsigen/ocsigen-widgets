(**

   Widget to upload a picture, check it on server side, resize it,
   and possibly ask the user to crop it.

*)
(**

   Call function [make] for each picture uploader you want to create,
   with some parameters like the directory where you want to save the
   pictures.
   This will create a service and the widget to upload in this
   directory using this service.

   Be careful to set the right options in Ocsigen server's configuration file
   to be able to upload files and limit the maximum size of uploaded files.

*)

[%%shared.start]

(** The type of picture uploaders. *)
type 'data t

(** Type of the data sent to the cropping function *)
type crop_type = string (* image name *) * (float * float * float * float)
                   [@@deriving json]

[%%server.start]
(** [make ~directory ~name ()] creates a picture uploader in [directory]
    with a service called [name] (choose the name you want, as lon g as two
    uploaders have different names).

    - If optional argument [crop_ratio] is present, the user will be asked
    to crop the picture. [None] means that no ratio will be forced.
    [Some  v] means that the widget will impose width / height = v.
    - Optional aguments [?max_height] and [?max_width] are used
    if you want the picture to be resized (for example to avoid large files).
    Images will never be enlarged.
    If the the image is to be cropped, the resizing will be made after cropping.
    - [?service_wrapper] is called on the upload service handlers.
    By default it is the identity function. But you can
    use this for example to add some action to the service (for example
    allow only connected users, or filter the result).
    - [?crop_wrapper] is a wrapper for the cropping function.
    By default it does nothing.
    The cropping function returns the file name on the server.

[%%shared.start]
(** Creates a form that will ask for an image, send it, possibly ask te user
    to crop it. On success, the continuation called as last parameter will
    be called with the name of the file on server as parameter
    (use this for example to close the popup window).

    - Argument [?send]: if given, the text used to mean "Send"
    - Argument [?crop]: if given, the text used to mean "crop"
    - Argument [?select_an_area_of_the_picture]: if given,
    the text used to mean "Select an area of the picture"
    - Argument [?fit_in_box]: if given, it is a client-side function that
    will be called with the container as argument and will be expected to
    return a couple [int option * int option], which represents the width
    and the height of the box in which the picture has to fit. If this
    argument is provided, we use the "box sizing method", otherwise
    we use the "explicit sizing method", as explained in
    http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Sizing_Issues.html
    If the function returns [None, None], it will neither use the box sizing
    method or the explicit sizing method.
    - Argument [~url_path] is the URL path of the directory containing
    these pictures on the server.
    - Argument [~text] is the text you want to display before the form.
    - Arguments [~err_log] and [std_log] are the client-side functions to use
    to display (error or information) messages. Example [Eba_msg.log]
    if you are using Eliom base app (as client values if you are using this
    from server side).

    It may raise an exception if something went wrong.
